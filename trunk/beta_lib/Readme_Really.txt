The beta folder contains code that is being evaluated. It might get to the library as is, or it might need some changes, or even a radical different train of thoughts.

This is also up to you, tester.

Not that the code is crap. We design it, test it. But it might fail for reasons outside the code.

Please do use the code, and tell us what you've learned from it.
